## About

As a football shirt collector, I found myself struggling to keep track of my growing collection. Spreadsheets felt clunky, notes got lost, and I had no way to visualize what I actually owned. So I built the tool I wished existed.

Football Shirt Collection is a modern web application that lets you catalog every jersey you own, track its value over time, and discover insights about your collection through beautiful charts and statistics. Whether you have 5 shirts or 500, this app helps you organize, analyze, and showcase your passion for football shirts.
