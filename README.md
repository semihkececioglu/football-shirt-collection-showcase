## About

As a football shirt collector, I found myself struggling to keep track of my growing collection. Spreadsheets felt clunky, notes got lost, and I had no way to visualize what I actually owned. So I built the tool I wished existed.

Football Shirt Collection is a modern web application that lets you catalog every jersey you own, track its value over time, and discover insights about your collection through beautiful charts and statistics. With the new social platform, you can follow other collectors, explore trending shirts, earn achievements, and build a community around your shared passion. Whether you have 5 shirts or 500, this app helps you organize, analyze, and showcase your collection.
